## Questions

1. Write a function to remove duplicate values from an array.  (Assume all values of the array are simple, lowercase strings) 


	In a normal situation, I would call array_unique().  

			$withoutDupes = array_unique($arrayOfStrings);


	If I was writing my own function for it, I would use an associative array/hash for it.

	function removeDuplicates($arrayOfStrings){

			$withoutDupes = [];

			foreach($arrayOfStrings as $string){
					$withoutDupes[$string] = 1;
			}

			return array_keys($withoutDupes);
	}




2. Why use server side filtering instead of client side filtering?

	If you want to send less data over from the server, if you're filtering on a large data set.
	
	

3. What is jQuery and why would you choose to use it, or choose not to use it?
	
	jQuery is a JavaScript library. It makes some things easier to do with less typing.
	I'm not sure why not to use it, I'll have to research this one.
	



4. What's wrong with this snippet of code?
	$name = $_POST['name'];
	$query = 'insert into friends (name) values ("' . $name . '")';
	mysqli_query($connection, $query);

		The insert statement should use binding to avoid SQL injection.
